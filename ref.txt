Coding Conventions 
--------------------
    Naming Conventions

        Class names             -- first letter capital
        method                  - camelCase
        variables               - camelCase


    Coding Terminologies 

            BO - Business Objects 

            SO - Service objects 

            DAO - Data access objects 

            POJO - plain old java object 

            Java Beans 

            DTO - Data transfer objects 







.java file   ------------------>    .class file  ------------> execute on your machine
             compile (javac)        (byte code)      jvm 


**Byte code = it is an intermediate code which understandable only to JVM

JVM - Java Virtual Machine 
    - it is responsible to execute the byte code on your machine 

JRE - java runtime environment 
    - JVM + standard libraries 

JDK - java development kit 
    - jre + development tools i.e .javac, java, jar etc. 



Java
------- 
    - object oriented programming language 

class 

objects 

Data types 
------------
    1. primitive types 
        - there are 8 primitive types 
        - primitive types represent values directly 

        byte        1 byte      -128 to 127
        short       2 bytes     -32768 to 32767
        int         4 bytes     .. to ..
        long        8 bytes 
        float       4 bytes 
        double      8 bytes 
        char        1 byte
        boolean     1 bit

    2. reference types 
        - variables of class / interface are called ref types
        - Employee / String / etc. 
        - ref type variables represent address of object 
                in the memory 

Variable types 
-----------------

    1. local variable 
        - variables declared inside a method / constructor or block 
        - memory is allocated when the method is called / executed 
                and the memory is destroyed when the method ends the execution
        - local variables must be initialized before first use 

    2. Instance variable 
        - Variables declared inside a class are called instance variables 
        - we can use access modifiers i.e. default / public / private / protected 
                to specify their accessibility 
        - memory for instance variables is allocated when the Object 
                is created using "new" keyword 

                Customer customer = new Customer()

        - memory for instane var will be deleted when the object is 
            destroyed 
        - instance variables have default values 
                numbers     = 0
                booleans    = false 
                ref types   = null

    3. static variable 
        - static variables are declared inside the class using 'static' keyword 
        -  we can use access modifiers i.e. default / public / private / protected 
                to specify their accessibility 
        - only **one copy of the static variable will be allocated per class
        - memory for static variable will be allocated when the class is loaded 


Garbadge Collection 
    - GC will automatically delete the objects which are unreferenced   



Static keyword 
-----------------

    - static variables 

    - static methods 

final keyword 
----------------
    - final variables 
            - cannot be modified 

    - final methods 
            - cannot be overridden 

    - final classes 
            - cannot be subclassed / inherited 


Scanner 
----------
    - Scanner class belongs to java.util package 
    - it is used to perform input operations i.e. input data from keyboard or a file or from any other input source 


System.in
-----------
    - "in" object in system class represents the default input stream which is connected
            with the standard keyboard



Encapsulation 
----------------
    - hiding the properties from external world 
    - a properly encapsulated class...
        - has all the members declared as private 
        - has appropriate public getter / setter methods for each instance members
        - has a default constructor to initialize default values 

class BankAccount {

    private int accoutNo;
    private double balance;


    public void setAccountNo(){

    }

    public void setBalance(double amount){
        //criteria / logic / condition
        this.balance = amount;
    }

}

Decision making statements 
    - if 
    - if - else 
    - if - else if - else 
    - switch 

logical operators 

relational operator 

Looping Statements 

    - while loop 

    - do - while loop 

    - for loop 


Array 
--------
    - group / list of similar items / elements 
    - in java, arrays are objects
    - array has fixed length
    - once array object is created, we cannot change its size 

    declare an array variable
    ---------------------------

        <data-type>[] arrVarName;

        int[] numbers;  //prefered syntax
        int [] numbers;
        int []numbers;
        int numbers[];

    Create an Array 
    --------------------------
        arrVarName = new <data-type>[size];

        numbers = new int[5];

    Initialize array values 
    --------------------------------

        numbers = new int[5];
        numbers[0] = 10
        numbers[1] = 20;
        ..
        ..
        ..

       numbers = new int[]{10,20,30,40,50} ;

       numbers = {10,20,30,40,50};


 

       String class 
       --------------
            - String are immutable

            - create a String object 

            String s1 = "Welcome";      //string literal

            String s2 = "Welcome";

            **whenever you create a string using String literal 
                it creates the String object in "String pool" only if it dones't exit 

            
            String s3 = new String("Welcome");


        StringBuilder class /  StringBuffer class   
                - are used to create immutable string 
                - *StringBuffer allows to crate thread-safe strings
